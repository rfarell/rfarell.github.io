        <h1>Value Usefulness...</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I’ve been thinking about how to spend my time (Time Management) and reached the conclusion that we need to maximize time on task [1] [2]. However, I had some new ideas that might serve as useful heuristics for delineating what types of tasks to work on. They might serve as useful heuristics to drastically reduce planning time without sacrificing quality [3].</p>
        <p>Value tasks that create output that is by itself useful. For example, in my scientific machine learning, I should prioritize creating my own explanation and implementation of research papers. That is, value reading, implementing, and proving or disproving the papers more than the quantity read or weak reimplementations. Here are the benefits:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Useful output. I have my own version of the code that I understand, have the confidence and know-how to implement for different configurations, etc. Validation of authors claims. Better written explanation. Or, disproval of the results [4]!</li>
            <li>A practical understanding of the paper and methods.</li>
            <li>Improved ability to quickly digest theory.</li>
            <li>Improved technical expertise in both practice and theory.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It might seem like everyone in academia does the above. However, I mean something very specifically. The useful output should be a GitHub repo and or a document that you are not afraid to make public, and it is of a quality that, if it were made public, would be useful to some group of people (you would be incentivized to make it public). A semester’s output might be 10-50 GitHub repos of useful code and writing. This is definitely not what most researchers do.</p>
        <p>Another focus is on generating useful GitHub repos [5]. What types of repos? Primarily working paper code implementations, but also my own ideas, and things I’m learning. In the case of my own ideas, the objective of this is to immediately test out my ideas and accept them or reject them. It is so important to quickly iterate over ideas. Don’t let them get stale. Either show that they are good and pursue them, or show that they are bad and move on. In the case of things I’m learning, the repo should include a well written explanation of the topic, as well as working and useful code implementation.</p>

        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I think there is another heuristic here which applies on how to distinguish things that require lots of planning versus things that require lots of practice, and all practice essentially created equal. Pursue this.</li>
            <li>I’m inclined to think that I underestimate the importance of not getting interrupted. I was interrupted while writing this and lost my train of thought.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve proved to yourself something is true, you’ve created a rapid decision making machine that produces the “best” output immediately. Giving yourself time to rethink through it only creates an environment to make reasoning mistakes and thus produces inferior output. Thus, derive something once. Show it is true. Then incorporate it into the process and trust the output.</li>
            <li>Don’t put false information in your head. Test the truth, and once accepted, then add and trust it.</li>
            <li>I think writing should fall in a similar category. I think people who are confident in their process and don’t shy away from sharing their ideas. People do shy away from situations where they think they might be marginalized. Putting something out in the public arena requires relinquishing some control on how it’s interpreted. However, this doesn’t seem to me to be the main reason why people would share in private to anyone but hesitate to share in public. That is that they lack confidence in the process, and if someone is revealed to have a weak processor, that is hard to overcome.</li>
